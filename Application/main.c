 *
 * This file contains is the source code for a sample application using the HID, Battery and Device
 * Information Services for implementing a simple keyboard functionality.
 * Pressing Button 0 will send text 'hello' to the connected peer. On receiving output report,
 * it toggles the state of LED 2 on the mother board based on whether or not Caps Lock is on.
 * This application uses the @ref app_scheduler.
 *
 * Also it would accept pairing requests from any peer device.
